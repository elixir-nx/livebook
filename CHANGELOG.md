# Changelog for Livebook v0.11

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

## [Unreleased](https://github.com/livebook-dev/livebook/tree/main)

This release introduces file management, you can now tell Livebook what files the notebook depends on, be it on your disk or on the web. In relation to this, the `images/` directory has been deprecated in favour of notebook attachments (files living in the `files/` directory). One way to migrate is to rename the `images/` directory to `files/`, open the files panel (in the session sidebar), then "Add file" and choose "From unlisted". If you want to automatically do this for a large repository of notebooks, you can try out [this script](https://gist.github.com/jonatanklosko/20e28aa772a888a25a829337a4b805e1).

This release introduces a **breaking change** to audio and image inputs. Previously input values (when read or received as an event) included a `:data` attribute with a binary. This attribute has been removed in favour of `:file_ref`, this way the binary is not stored in the memory upfront and it is up to the user to read it or stream it depending on the use case. For more information on the API, see [Kino v0.11.0 changelog](https://github.com/livebook-dev/kino/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#user-content-v0110-2023-10-06).
